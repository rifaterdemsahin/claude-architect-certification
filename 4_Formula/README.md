# 4️⃣ Formula — The "Thinking & Planning" Stage

> **Stage 4 of 7:** Think and plan before acting. Mandatory gate between understanding the problem (`1–3`) and writing code (`5_Symbols`).

## 📋 Root Files Reference

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `llm_thinking_log.md` | **Primary** — LLM reasoning logged before and after every implementation |
| `decisions.md` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — why X over Y |
| `dsl.md` | Domain-specific language and terminology |
| `implementation_guide.md` | Main step-by-step build sequence |
| `research_notes.md` | Technology evaluations that informed decisions |
| `api_reference.md` | Key API endpoints (Qdrant, Claude, Azure Key Vault, GitHub Actions) |
| `mcp_deployment_formula.md` | 🧠 Where `temp_mcp.yml` should live — GitHub vs Fly.io pros/cons + split model |

## 📐 Subfolders Reference

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `certification/` | Course outline, exam design, and production planning for the Claude Architect Certification |
| `delivery_pilot/` | Delivery Pilot framework — thinking log for template improvements |
| `production/` | Video and content production workflow (scripts, prompter, Google Drive, MCP) |
| `security/` | Security checklists and ZDR planning |
| `tools/` | Developer environment setup: VS Code extensions, markdown preview config |
| `topologies/` | Multi-agent flow diagrams and architecture topologies |
| `.claude/` | Init template — copy to new project root to bootstrap Claude Code config |

## ✅ Rules

- **Think before you code** — log the plan in `llm_thinking_log.md` before touching `5_Symbols`
- **Log after execution** — append the LLM reasoning summary once done
- Write the *why*, not just the *what* — reasoning decays fastest
- Link research notes to the decisions they informed
- Move superseded guides to `_obsolete/` 🚮

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

[![Architecture Decision Records & Design](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g1mS6_u4tIY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1mS6_u4tIY)

- [ ] `llm_thinking_log.md` has an entry for every implementation in `5_Symbols`
- [ ] All major decisions have an ADR in `decisions.md`
- [ ] `research_notes.md` references sources for each evaluation
- [ ] `implementation_guide.md` covers all major features
- [ ] `api_reference.md` is accurate for current service versions
