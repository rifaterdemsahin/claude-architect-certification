## 2026-06-12 — Remove Supabase Connection from Producer Checklist

### 🎯 Objective
Remove the Supabase connection dependency from the Producer Checklist page ([producer_checklist.html](file:///Users/rifaterdemsahin/projects/claude-architect-certification/5_Symbols/production/preprod/producer_checklist.html)) and migrate task management to use `localStorage` instead, making the page fully self-contained and functional without an active database.

### 📐 Design & Implementation Plan
1. **HTML Cleanup**:
   - Remove the `<details class="config-panel" id="configDetails">` containing the Supabase URL, Key, and Connect/Seed buttons.
   - Remove the `<details class="sql-card">` containing the SQL setup commands and "Copy SQL" button.
   - Keep the AI Daily Plan Banner at the top for project tracking as it's required for AI agent visibility.
2. **JavaScript Migration (Supabase -> localStorage)**:
   - Keep `STAGES` and `SEED` objects.
   - Implement local functions to initialize tasks in `localStorage` from `SEED` if no checklist data exists yet.
   - Update `loadAll()`, `toggleTask()`, `saveEdit()`, `addTask()`, and `removeTask()` to perform operations directly on the locally stored array/objects in `localStorage`.
   - Keep the progress calculation logic (`refreshStats()`) completely intact.
   - Keep the clean design, Outfit/Jakarta typography, glassmorphism UI rules, and active top navigation links.
3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure the app builds, renders default steps, and supports CRUD operations in the browser without attempting any database calls.
